Explanation of Fix:
Dynamic Execution:

Deno allows you to dynamically import and execute TypeScript files. This approach effectively simulates how a TypeScript execution engine would work.
Temporary File:

A temporary file (temp.ts) is created for the code, which is dynamically imported and executed.
Permissions:

Deno requires specific permissions (--allow-read, --allow-write) to manage files and execute code.
Error Handling:

Included error handling for cases where the code has syntax errors or other runtime issues.
