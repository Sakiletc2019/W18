    <h1>W18 TypeScript Execution Engine</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the W18 TypeScript Execution Engine project. This tool is designed to parse and execute TypeScript code efficiently.</p>
    <p>We are excited to announce that the W18 engine is being integrated with Chromium to support TypeScript code directly in browsers. Developers will soon be able to use <code>&lt;script type="ts"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script type="typescript"&gt;</code> tags to run TypeScript code seamlessly.</p>
    <p>This integration will allow the HTML parser to auto-detect TypeScript code and execute it using the W18 engine, solving challenges for developers who prefer working with TypeScript.</p>
    <p>The W18 engine, written in TypeScript and tested with the Deno 2.0 runtime environment, has been rewritten in C++ for Chromium integration. It has been tested in its primary stage with Chromium and works properly. Stay tuned for updates as we continue development!</p>
    <p>We are currently developing an HTML parser for Chromium that can auto-detect TypeScript code and execute it using the W18 engine. This will allow developers to write TypeScript code directly in `&lt;script &gt;` tags and have it executed seamlessly in the browser.</p>
