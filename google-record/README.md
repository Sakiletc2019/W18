# W18
 TypeScript Execution Engine 

**W18** is a TypeScript execution engine that runs TypeScript code directly inside a web browser, similar to how the V8 JavaScript engine executes JavaScript. It allows developers to embed TypeScript in HTML files using the `<script>` tag, with the code being executed under the hood. W18 leverages **TypeScript** for development and **Deno** as the runtime environment.


## Features

- Execute TypeScript code directly in the browser using the `<script>` tag.
- Fully compatible with modern TypeScript syntax.
- Parse and execute TypeScript code in a browser environment.
- Aims to replicate the behavior of JavaScript engines like V8 for TypeScript.
